# 👋 Hi, I'm **Alisher**
### **SDET / Automation Engineer — Web, Mobile & AI-driven Testing**

I build **engineering-level automation frameworks** with strong emphasis on  
**architecture**, **stability**, **scalability**, and **AI-augmented testing**.

---

## 🚀 About Me

- 🧱 Designing clean automation architectures (POM, modular helpers, fixtures)  
- 🌐 Web automation with **Playwright** (deep DOM analysis, stability patterns)  
- 📱 Mobile automation with **WebdriverIO + Appium** (cross-platform POM)  
- 🤖 AI-enabled test generation (JSON schema → template → executable tests)  
- 🧠 R&D: self-healing locators, DOM diffing, automated failure reasoning  

My focus:  
**build frameworks that help teams scale, not just write tests.**

### 🤖 **AI-Driven Test Agents (R&D)**
Framework for AI-augmented test execution:
- Multi-step user simulation  
- Automated DOM analysis  
- Failure reasoning & diagnosis  
- Controlled JSON schema for stable test generation  

📌 Repo → https://github.com/alisher-sdet/ai_ag

### 📱 **Mobile Automation Framework (WebdriverIO + Appium)**  
Cross-platform automation design:
- Strategy locators (Android/iOS)  
- Unified mobile POM  
- Emulator/device configuration  
- Touch actions, gestures, synchronization  

*(Updated during Week 2 of training)*
