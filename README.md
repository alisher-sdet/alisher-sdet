# 👋 Hi, I'm **Alisher**  
### **SDET / Automation Engineer — Web, Mobile, and AI-driven Testing**

I design and build **engineering-level automation frameworks** — not just tests.  
My work focuses on **architecture**, **stability**, **scalability**, and **AI-assisted automation**.

---

## 🔥 What I Do

### 🧱 **Automation Architecture**
- Playwright + POM (clean structure, locator maps, helpers)
- WebdriverIO + Appium (cross-platform mobile automation)
- Scalable test design: actions, asserts, fixtures, network filters
- Stable, deterministic automation for complex UI behaviors

### 🤖 **AI for Test Automation**
- Natural language → structured JSON → runnable test code  
- Template generators for Web & Mobile (Mini-Project C)
- Self-healing locators (DOM diff + AI suggestion)
- R&D in automated framework refactoring and test synthesis

### 🌐 **Web Automation**
- Advanced Playwright use:  
  - robust waits  
  - custom fixtures  
  - selective network interception  
  - DOM analyzers for unstable UI

### 📱 **Mobile Automation**
- WebdriverIO + Appium  
- Strategy locators (Android/iOS)  
- Cross-platform POM & unified test logic
